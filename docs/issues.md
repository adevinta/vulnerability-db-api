# Issues

Issues are the fundamental weakness detected, regardless of the assets on which they are found. That's why issues don't have a lifecycle or state, they only hold information related to their security implications.

The issues stored in the Vulnerability DB are not a static set, instead they are regularly expanded by new issues reported from the vulnerability detection sources that communicate with the VulnDB.

## Querying the API for issues

The Vulnerability Database API provides different methods to query information about the issues currently present in the system.

### List Issues
List issues endpoint allows to query all the issues currently present in the Vulnerability Database. 
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.vulcan.com/issues"
```

### Get Issue
The Get Issue endpoint allows to query information related with a particular issue, specifying its ID.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.vulcan.com/issues/0205a902-64a7-4c77-8d00-5d4c8d06399a"
```

### List Findings by Issue
Sometimes we might want to know which findings are associated with a specific issue. For example, we might want to know which findings are related to TLS POODLE vulnerability.
The _List_ _Findings_ _by_ _Issue_ endpoint allows us to do just that, specifying the vulnerability ID for which we want to list its findings. Because we are querying for findings, we can set _status_ querystring param to filter only the ones that are currently _OPEN_ or _FIXED_.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.vulcan.com/issues/20289f5d-8c6e-40e7-81a3-b3e2e0f7fbe5/findings?status=OPEN"
```

### List Targets by Issue
Similar to _List_ _Findings_ _by_ _Issue_, this endpoint allows to query the list of assets/targets that are affected by a specific issue.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.vulcan.com/issues/20289f5d-8c6e-40e7-81a3-b3e2e0f7fbe5/targets"
```

### Get Finding by Issue and Target
This endpoint allows users to get the data for the _finding_ correspondent to a specific _issue_ and _target_.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.vulcan.com/issues/c6a1099c-6141-415c-8fd8-30d68aedb90c/targets/dc7fdc6c-e9d2-4e63-9ef1-ffce36ad6352"
```

### Issue MTTR
MTTR stands for _Mean Time To Remediate_, and is the average time that elapses since the vulnerability is found until it is fixed.
This endpoint allows to query that average time specifically for one particular issue.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.vulcan.com/issues/20289f5d-8c6e-40e7-81a3-b3e2e0f7fbe5/mttr"
```
