# Targets

The targets are the assets related to Adevinta organization for which at least one vulnerability has been found. These can be domains, hostnames, web adresses, IPs, AWS Accounts, Docker images, Git repositories, etc.

## Querying the API for targets

The Vulnerability Database API provides different methods to query information about the targets currently present in the system.

### List Targets
List targets endpoint allows to query all the targets currently present in the Vulnerability Database. 
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.example.com/targets"
```

### Get Target
The Get Target endpoint allows to query information related with a particular target, specifying its ID.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.example.com/targets/0205a902-64a7-4c77-8d00-5d4c8d06399a"
```

### List Findings by Target
Sometimes we might want to know which findings are associated with a specific target. For example, we might want to know which findings are related with _adevinta.com_.
The _List Findings by Target_ endpoint allows us to do just that, specifying the target ID for which we want to list its findings. Because we are querying for findings, we can set _status_ querystring param to filter only the ones that are currently _OPEN_ or _FIXED_.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.example.com/targets/2e379d3a-9fe6-4edb-8f81-dd476d9568f2/findings?status=OPEN"
```

### List Issues by Target
Similar to _List Findings by Target_, this endpoint allows to query the list of issues that at some point were found for a specific target.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.example.com/targets/2e379d3a-9fe6-4edb-8f81-dd476d9568f2/issues"
```

### Get Finding by Target and Issue
This endpoint allows users to get the data for the _finding_ correspondent to a specific _target_ and _issue_.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.example.com/targets/dc7fdc6c-e9d2-4e63-9ef1-ffce36ad6352/issues/c6a1099c-6141-415c-8fd8-30d68aedb90c"
```

### Target MTTR
MTTR stands for _Mean Time To Remediate_, and is the average time that elapses since the vulnerability is found until it is fixed.
This endpoint allows to query that average time for vulnerabilities related to a particular target.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.example.com/targets/2e379d3a-9fe6-4edb-8f81-dd476d9568f2/mttr"
```
