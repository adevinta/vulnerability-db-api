# Finding Events

_Findings_ can be reported many times by different sources, each one of these "found" events is a _finding\_event_.

## Querying the API for finding events

The Vulnerability Database API provides different methods to query information about the _finding events_.

### List Finding Events
List finding events endpoint allows to query all the _finding events_ currently present in the Vulnerability Database.

These can be filtered by _score_ and _date ranges_.

For example we might want to query all _finding events_ for high and critical vulnerabilities that were found in Q4 of 2019:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
"https://vulnerabilitydb.vulcan.com/events?minScore=7&minDate=2019-10-01&maxDate=2019-12-31"
```
